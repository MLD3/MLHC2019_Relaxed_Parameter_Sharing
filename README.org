* Directory structures

lib/ contains implementation for mixLSTM

ARFshock/ contains code for ARF and shock dataset

mortality/ contains code for in hospitial mortality dataset

synthetic/ contains code for synthetic dataset

* Download and Process the Data 
Follow directions to complete the set up for the MIMIC III Benchmark dataset for in-hospital mortality: [[https://github.com/YerevaNN/mimic3-benchmarks]].



* Running the code

TODO: Jeeheh, could you describe the command for running the code here? there are options such as real_data I'm not familiar with
TODO: Also, please remove any absolute path in the file and any comment with joh or jeeheh in it
